1 why we use dynamic xpath
	- It is used to locate ur webelement
	- It allows you to locate elements on a web page based on their dynamic characteristics, such as changing IDs, names, classes, or other attributes.
 
 1 absolute xpath
		-/ -> used single slash to calculate 
		- it starts from its root node or base node => /html 
		- we can not get shortest path from absolute xpath  
		- If any required is updated(enhancement) from client in web application then it fails to locate ur webElement
 2 relative xpath
	 - // => relative path used double slash to calculate
	 - it calculate nearest node to locate ur webElement
	 - It get shortest path of particular webElement
	 <div id="maindiv">
		<div>
			<p>
	 - we get shortest xpath 
		
		//tagname[@id='value']
		@id,@name,@class
