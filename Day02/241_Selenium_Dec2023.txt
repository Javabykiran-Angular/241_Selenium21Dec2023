1 What is Application?
2 Difference Between Manual testing & automation testing 

	1 Speed 
		Manual testing => Manual testing requires human resources and is time consuming as well.
		automation testing => Automation Testing is faster than a manual testing.
	2 Exploratory Testing 
		Manual testing =>It is possible in case of Manual Testing
		automation testing => Automation will not allow any random testing.
	3 Investment 
		Manual testing => The initial investment for manual testing is lower.
		automation testing => The initial investment for automation testing is higher.
	4 Reliability
		Manual testing => Manual testing wonâ€™t be as accurate as there is a possibility of the human error.
		automation testing => Automation Testing is more reliable, as it is performed by tools and scripts.
	5 Cost-effective
		Manual testing => Manual Testing is not cost effective as ROI is lower.
		automation testing =>Automation Testing is cost effective.
	6 Test Reports
		Manual testing =>Manual Tests are usually updated in an Excel/Word, and test results are not readily available.
		automation testing =>In automation testing, all stakeholders check test execution results by logging into automation system.
	7 Performance Testing
		Manual testing => Performance Testing is difficult to do manually.
		automation testing => Performance Tests like Stress Testing, Load Testing, Spike Testing, etc. have to be done by an automation tool only.
	8 Set up
		Manual testing => Manual testing needs have a straightforward test execution setup.
		automation testing => It needs less complex test execution set up.
	9 Deadlines
		Manual testing => Manual Testing has a higher chances of missing out the test deadlines.
		automation testing => Automated Tests will not have risks of missing out any test deadlines.
	10 When to Use?
		Manual testing => It will be suitable for Usability, Exploratory, and Adhoc Testing.
		automation testing => It is well suited for Regression Testing, Load Testing, Performance Testing, or repeatable functional test cases.
		
3 what is Selenium?
	- It is automation S/W / tool 
	- It is used to test for web Application Testing/automation 
	- With Less time u can execute the test case 
	
4 Advantage of Selenium
	- It is used for Web Application Testing 
	- It support all cross browser platform

	- it supports most of programming lang. (core java, c#,python,ruby,javascript);
	
5 Disaadvantage of selenium
	- It is more time to implement
	- we can not test images,pdf file , captcha etc 
	- we can not test mobile native application 
	- we can not test desktop application (cal,doc,excel)
