1 Explain Dynamic Xpath?/how many xpath is present in selenium?/what is xpath?
=> dhanraj, komal, tanuja

- It is used to locate ur webelement
	- It allows you to locate elements on a web page based on their dynamic characteristics, such as changing IDs, names, classes, or other attributes.
	It has two type such as 
   
 1 absolute xpath
		-/ -> used single slash to calculate 
		- it starts from its root node(i.e. html) or base node => /html 
		- we can not get shortest path from absolute xpath 
		- If web application is enhanced then this absolute xpath is falied to locate a particular webelement
 2 relative xpath
	 - // => relative path used double slash to calculate xpath
	 - it calculate nearest node to locate ur webElement
	 <div>
		<div>
			<p>
	 - we get shortest xpath 
		for e.g 
		//tagname[@id='value']

2 How to handle browser controls?/How to use navigation command?/Do you know navigation command 
=> mohini,Namrata
	
	- By Using navigate method.It is present in webDriver interface 
	- with navigate method we can use back,forward and refresh browser controls 
	driver.navigate().back();
	driver.navigate().forward();
	
3 What is Synchronization?
=> hemant 
	In Selenium, synchronization refers to the process of managing the timing and interaction between the test script(selenium) and the web application being tested. It ensures that the test script waits for specific conditions to be met before performing actions or assertions on the web elements.
	
	Web applications often have dynamic content, asynchronous behavior, and delays in loading or processing. As a result, test scripts may need to wait for elements to become visible, enabled, or updated before interacting with them or verifying their state.
	
1 Implicit Waits: Implicit waits instruct the Selenium WebDriver to wait for a certain amount of time for elements to become available before throwing an exception. The WebDriver will implicitly wait for the specified time before attempting to find or interact with an element.

	2 Explicit Waits: Explicit waits provide more control over waiting conditions. Testers can define custom conditions using the ExpectedConditions class and specify a maximum wait time. Explicit waits wait until the condition is met or a timeout occurs.
	
	3 Thread.sleep(): Although not a recommended approach, Thread.sleep() is a general-purpose Java method that pauses the execution of the script for a specified time. It introduces fixed delays and is less flexible compared to other synchronization techniques.

4 what is testng?
	=> Ankita Kumbhar , Kulkarni,
	
5 What does getwindowhandles() and getwindowhandle() return? Or its differences?
	=> purvesh, tanuja
	driver.SwitchTo().window()
6 What is NullPointerException?When it occurs?
	=> Kulkarni , Dhanraj, Komal, hemant 
	- If u r createing a refrence variable & that refrence variable does not have any memeory address & ur using it then it is called nullpointer
	- If u r  creating a reference & not storeing object into that , still u r accessing its element or method then it gives nullpointerexception.
	- Null Pointer Exception Occurs at the runtime.
	
	
7 How to verify 'Bangalore' present in dropdown box or not?
	
	WebElement element= driver.findElement(By.xpath(""));
	Select select=new Select(element);
		select.selectByIndex(1)
		select.selectByVisibleText("Banglore");
		select.selectByValue("..")
		boolean status= select.isSelected();
	
8 How to Handling WebTable(static and dynamic) in selenium?
	=> Dhanraj, purvesh,hemant 
	
	List<WebElement> list= driver.findElements(By.tagName("tr"));
		for(int i=0;i<list.size();i++){
			List<WebElement> colList= list.get(i).findElements(By.tagName("td"));
			
			for(intj=0;j<8);j++){
				colList.get(j).getText();
				
			}
			
		}
